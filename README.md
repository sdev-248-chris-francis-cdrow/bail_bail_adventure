# Bail Bail Adventure

**Bail Bail Adventure** is a 2D side-scrolling platformer starring a nervous little dog named *Bailey*, who must collect her lost balls and make it back home before bedtime. But it won’t be easy — the world is crawling with dangerous **Technichans** and wild **Squirrels**, both causing mayhem in their own awful ways.

Inspired by my real dog, this game mixes platforming, light combat, and a little emotional chaos.

## Story

Bail’s balls have gone missing again, and Momma’s too tired to help. It’s up to Bail to find them herself, even if it means braving the dark woods. She’ll have to deal with two threats: the weird gadget-obsessed **Technichans**, and the hyper-aggressive **Squirrels** who really don’t want her around.

Can Bail stay brave, find her toys, and get back before Momma wakes up?
